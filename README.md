  ## Description

  This budget tracker application allows a user the ability to add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without an internet connection. When entering transactions offline, the application populates the total when brought back online. This is great for travellers who want to be able to track withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection so that their account balance is accurate when traveling.

  This browser-based application uses IndexedDB to keep offline transactions recorded until the user is able to access an internet connection. A service worker is used to cache files to keep the user up to date, even offline. This application is deployed to Heroku and uses Atlas and MongoDB for server-side data storage.
